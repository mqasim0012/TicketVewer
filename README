# TicketViewer

Technologies:
    -   React.js frontend to develop the ticketing system
    -   Express.js backend to fetch the tickets


How to run:
    -   Put AuthO token in .env file to ensure API works
    -   Install node and npm if not present
    -   In a terminal, from this directory, start backend by:
    $   cd backend
    $   make
    and then, in a seperate terminal, starting from this directory, start frontend:
    $   cd frontend
    $   npm i
    $   npm run start

TESTS:
    Since everything is exclusively frontend, tests are also exclusively frontend:
    To run tests, go to frontend:
    $   cd frontend
    $   npm run test

Further notes on app:
    -   App Structure:
        - GET call to zendesk API in backend/server.js
        - Standard react structure:
            - All user-written frontend files stored in frontend/TicketViewer
        Each component has its own folder:
            - index.js file to make imports simpler
            - Test files for each component are stored in the same folder
            - Some components have simple CSS files to ensure readable UI
            - API calls are stored in seperate getTickets folder
    -   The application has a "Loading..." text that appears until the promise is resolved (will timeout so it's fine).
    -   Completely async app, including a defined promise in frontend/TicketViewer/getTickets/getTickets.js


    -   Was unable to pay attention to UI given time constraints and other responsibilities during the week (still ensured it's reasonable)
    -   Did not take advantage of supplementary APIs since I was told to fetch all tickets at once and only use that by the coding challenge prompt
    -   Tests:
        -   Render tests
        -   Button click tests
        -   No other type tests as there is no other UI/UX complication in my application design

ASIDE:
    IF you choose to run server processes in background, please remember to kill processes before trying to restart app
